lab1b-105123806.tar.gz which contains:
lab1b-server.c
lab1b-client.c
README (this file)
Makefile

Makefile: 
default ... builds lab1b-client and lab1b-server exec, 
clean ... deletes files created by the Makefile
dist ... builds a distribution tarball of files: lab1b-client.c,lab1b-server.c
Makefile, README, lab1b-105123806.tar.gz

client .. builds lab1b-client exec
server ... builds lab1b-server exec

Description of project:
Compressed network communication
socket programming
Client and server where the server has interprocess communication to the shell via pipes

Testing methodology
Opening two terminals and running ./lab1b-server --port=# --compress (and without --compress)
./lab1b-client --port=# --log=log.txt --compress (and without --compress)
Typing commands and invalid commands, CTRLD, and CTRLC, etc to see if behavior
matched project 1A interms of what is echoed out on the client exec running
Seeing if exit signals are consistent with project 1A
Opening log.txt too see if bytes being sent make sense
